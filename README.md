# CSV and JSON file Manipulation
Part I. Using the Government dataset on Waiting at Driver Testing Centres [1], figure out and 
display the top 3 centres with the shortest and longest waiting time each year (from 2003 to 
2019). 
1.  Downloading file and save as Question 1.xlsx or Question 1.csv 
2.  Loading Question 1.xlsx (or .csv) file into dataframe 
3.  Finding the top 3 centres with the shortest and longest waiting time each year, display 
results and save into JSON file. <br />
Data[1] = https://data.gov.ie/dataset/roa09-waiting-at-driver-testing-centres 

Part II. Parse the JSON file containing weather statistics from API link [2]. Calculate the 
temperature and evapotranspiration as below. 
1.  Download file data file and save as WeatherClaremorris.json with human-readable 
format. 
2.  Display all types of information from API 
3.  Calculate the average temperature each year and display them in descending order 
4.  Extract temperature, rainfall, evaporation information and display them as table: 
Location | Year | Month | Temperature | Rainfall | Evaporation 
5.  Save result to WeatherClaremorris.csv <br />
Data[2] = https://prodapi.metweb.ie/monthly-data/Claremorris
